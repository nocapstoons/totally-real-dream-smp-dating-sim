# totally-real-dream-smp-dating-sim
Dream "Dating Sim" I made as a joke. Basically a reskin of the Ren'Py default game "The Question". 


--HOW TO USE--
1) Download Ren'Py from https://www.renpy.org
2) Extract the .zip (Including the "Totally Real DreamSMP Dating Sim" folder) directly into the root of your Ren'Py install folder.
3) Open Ren'Py (renpy.exe or renpy-32.exe for 32-bit computers)
4) It *should* be working.
